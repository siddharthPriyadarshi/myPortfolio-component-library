    <p >Startled! Right?. Are u pondering how anyone can appreciate a devil? Most of Bollywood movies oftenly project
        villains as follower of devils or daemons.Can devil be right? A devil can be right if manners are not to fight.
        <br><br>
        Devils and Heroes are the opposite parts of same coin. For readers, one cant be a powerful hero until there is a
        powerfull villain. Hero without a villain is null.
        <br><br>
        Consider a world throng with uncategorised homogeneous living beings.How can you distinguish the hero and the
        evil?
        <br><br>
        What would have happend if Ravana and its empire did not exist? <br><br>
        What would have happend if Kans did not exist? <br><br>
        We would have been unware about the Lord Rama and Lord Krishna, the mighty and indomitable. <br><br>
        History is the key evidence which proves hero cant exist without existence of evil.<br><br>
        Every human is a hero. Individuals are aware of there pros and cons. One can achieve anything based his
        disciplined efforts, persistence, etc.. And every human is a villain. Surprised! Again ? A harsh reality but
        true. Hero and villain is 'nt the name of person, organ or living thing's name. Its all about thinking and
        reacting.<br>
