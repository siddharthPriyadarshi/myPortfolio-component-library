                    A senior lecturer in management at the University of Exeter has suggested a number of wise-cracking
                    robots have the emotional intelligence required to make them suitable for leadership roles.<br><br>

                    9 ERP use cases you should not miss<br>
                    The rise of machine learning and AI in the workplace has been well documented over the past few
                    years, and the growth of the machine is unquestionable. However, recent shifts in AI technology are
                    now specifically having an impact on ERP software. Download this e-guide to read more.<br><br>

                    Writing in the European Business Review, future of work expert Jamie Gloor casts our minds to famous
                    android entertainers such as Sophia to illustrate the importance of humour.<br><br>

                    “Funny AI is impressive because humour requires several soft skills – creativity to combine
                    seemingly unrelated concepts in a funny way and emotional intelligence to deploy it in an
                    appropriate context, as well as to evaluate and respond to feedback,” she said.<br><br>


                    One lesser-known robot, known only by his stage name, Data, is also being put forward as a candidate
                    to move into a career in business, and with the reopening date of live venues still unknown, there
                    wouldn’t be any shame in him at least thinking about it.<br><br>

                    While Sophia’s very likely being welcomed back into Fortnum’s Lodge as we speak, gorging on Scotch
                    eggs and guzzling Krug Grande Cuvée with celebrity pal Holly Willoughby, it’s time for struggling
                    robot comedians like Data to get real.<br><br>

                    And don’t worry about us. If we need a joke, we can just ask Alexa to tell us again about the song
                    she wrote about a tortilla: “Actually, it’s more of a wrap.” Dear Lord, what a sad little life.
