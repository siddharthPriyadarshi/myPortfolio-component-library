                <h1>Which suppliers cannot deliver rural broadband by 2025?<small>(Dummy Blog-2)</small></h1>
                <p>by Dale Vile</p>

                <p>
                    The postponement of most of the £5 billion rural broadband programme because currently dominant
                    suppliers say they cannot deliver is therefore a bizarre capitulation to vested interests.<br><br>

                    It had long been obvious that it was not in the commercial interests of BT to divert resources into
                    rural broadband unless paid for by the public sector. The pressure to upgrade its core network to
                    handle growing competition to provide the fast, reliable, resilient and converged services now
                    demanded by business and consumers (from BT Retail, Wholesale and EE), is now such that it cannot
                    afford to do so, even if heavily subsidised.<br><br><br>


                    Allowing others to do so, using different technologies or business models, supported by some of
                    £billions available from private sector fund managers or from customers (were they able to pay up
                    front for 3 – 5 year contracts) was, and is, equally not in BT’s interest.<br><br>

                    Nor is it in the interest of those (like Virgin or City Fibre) who want potentially scarce resources
                    to be concentrated on enabling them to compete with BT and/or to fibre up would-be smart cities.<br><br>

                    The choices have, course, been complicated by the decision to exclude Huawei from the critical
                    national infrastructure on grounds of “security” (alias economic and/or cyber warfare) and the
                    Brexit negotiations on state aid.<br><br>

                    Given that low cost, mass produced Huawei equipment designed for robust operation under extreme
                    conditions across rural China has come to dominate markets across most of the Southern Hemisphere,
                    it might be ideal for rural Britain, without jeopardising national security. Given that the Huawei
                    products lines are designed to international standards using Western IPR such procurements need not
                    lead to any longer term technology lock-ins.<br><br>

                    [I learned my “trade” with STC Microwave and Line. STL Harlow was later at the heart of Nortel’s
                    R&D. I have conflicted views on this subject.]<br><br>

                    Instead we need action to collate demand and rapidly expand the supply of digital infrastructure
                    construction skills – e.g. hands-on, short course, modules, delivered via commercial
                    training/assessment providers and technical/agricultural colleges with access to simulation
                    equipment and/or brown field and green field practice sites.
